# Coding Problems

## The Idea

This is to hold code from problem sets retrieved from leetcode. I'm not so much concerned with getting as many problems done as I can, but rather focused on reinforcing the conceptual ideas behind them.

## Contents

The main directory will contain each main-topic. Within each main-topic will be a list of sub-topics. Each sub-topic will contain 10 or so problem sets. Each problem set will have the following:

-   Problem Statement
-   Problem Restatement & Pseudocode
-   Solution in C
-   Solution in Python
-   Time Complexity for Solutions

### Extra Notes

This entire repo will be pretty overkill- as such is intended. If for some reason you find this and see any errors, or would like to judge my code, I'd love to hear it.

I will likely add these to my website i've created for CS related topics. This is also just a personal site to practice web development, using stuff like this for content. Also open to judgement there.

Cheers
